Carbon
================
Material Design implementation for Android 2.1 and newer. This is not the exact copy of the Lollipop's API and features. It's a custom implementation of the most useful things as shown in the design specification. The library also features some additional non-standard extensions, like rounded corners for layouts or a Divider view for easy divider creation.

### Features
 - realtime, animated shadows
 - the touch ripple
 - an elevation system (changing z order changes view rendering order)
 - rounded corners
 - SVG rendering
 - a floating action button view
 - text appearances, sizes, colors and many more useful definitions
 - roboto and roboto condensed fonts for buttons and text fields
 - predefined animation styles and visibility change animations
 - a saturation/brightness/alpha fade for ImageView
 - Divider, StatusBar and NavigationBar drag&drop view
 - dark and light themes in standard and AppCompat versions
 - a radial transition animation

### Instalation
There's no Maven package yet, so you have to clone the repository and import it as a module to your project:
 - clone the repo
 - open your project
 - right click the project -> New -> Module -> Import Existing Project
 - set the dependency

### FAQ
##### Is it stable?
Seems like it's pretty stable. I'm testing it heavily on different devices and on real projects. There are minor problems with SVG rendering and shadow generation. Also the themes aren't perfect yet. These are the issues I know about. If you have something else, please let me know.

##### Are you using Lollipop's API on Lollipop devices?
No. Maybe one day.

##### Are you thinking about uploading the library to Maven?
Yes. I just don't have time to set it up.

##### Can you add [put your feature name here]?
If it's possible and reasonable, sure! Just let me know.

##### The shadows aren't working. It says something about the RenderScript
You have to add these lines to your android build config:

    renderscriptTargetApi 20
    renderscriptSupportModeEnabled true
    
Carbon uses RenderScript for generating shadows. Gradle doesn't support renderscript very well, so it has to be done that way.
